# PreciseOncoDetect
Early Cancer Detection Using Advanced Multi-modal Image Alignment Techniques

### Objective

Develop a comprehensive tool for early detection of rare or less common cancers, utilizing the advanced multi-modal medical image alignment techniques from the previous project. The goal is to leverage the precision of aligned diagnostic scans to improve the detection and diagnosis of early-stage cancers.

### Target Cancer Types

Focus on rare or less commonly studied cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or specific types of brain tumors.
